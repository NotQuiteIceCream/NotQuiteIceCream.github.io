                            <br>The first Yumini was topped with Rocky Road. After attending a family
                            birthday party, it was obvious Yumini needed a topping that can be enjoyed
                            by all generations. So Yumini topped with a 'cocobliss ball' was created.
                            Yumini are great for birthday parties, weddings, functions, baby showers
                            and&nbsp;girls night-in. &nbsp;&nbsp;

                                Australian ingredients whenever possible.

                            <h4 class="text-primary">Can I buy the Yumini DIY kits for a childrens party?</h4>
                            <p>Absolutely! For parties, we found that young children (4-7 years old) can manage one Yumini &nbsp;on their own. Older children can manage two Yuminis on their own.&nbsp;<br>

                            <p>Yes - the DIY kit can be shipped Australia wide. We use Australia Post
                                or Sendle.

                            <p>The bliss balls, dipping chocolate and all sprinkles topping are gluten
                                free. The only gluten containing component of Yumin is the mini waffle
                                cone. The cone can be replaced by a lollypop stick. Just indicate that
                                you need a gluten free Yumini DIY kit when you order.

                            <p>Tempering chocolate is an essential step for making smooth, glossy, evenly
                                coloured coating for your dipped chocolates. If you plan to make Yumini
                                in advance for your event, we suggest that you temper the dark chocolate
                                for dipping. We can provide you with instruction to how to temper chocolate
                                when you order Yumini.

                            <p>Yumini supports Breast Cancer Network Australia (BCNA) and CanTeen. Shirley

                            <p>Store Yumini at room temperature in an airtight container in cool dry
                                places and away from direct sunlight once they are made. Refrigeration
                                is not recommended as the cool temperature may cause the chocolate to '
                                bloom' - a white colour layer on top of the chocolate. Blooming does not
                                affect the quality of chocolate, just the appearance.

                            <h4 class="text-primary">How long does it last once I receive them?</h4>
                            <p>Yumini is made with all natural ingredients with no preservatives. 'Best
                                By' date is indicated on the label. For Yumini the date is two months from

                            It was started by Shirley Chan who is a mum of two beautiful girls.
                            <br>
                            <br>As a dietitian with 15 years of clinical experience in public and private
                            sector and a mum, Shirley made Yumini (short for 'Yummy Mini' ) for one
                            of her daughter's birthday party so the party treats are fun and also contain
                            good nutrition.Yumini was a huge success.&nbsp;
                            <br>
                            <br>One year before her daughter's birthday, Shirley was diagonsed with breast
                            cancer. During treatment, Shirley received support&nbsp;from Breast Cancer

                            to recover from cancer both physically and emotionally. Not Quite Ice Cream
                            supports BCNA by making an annual donation.&nbsp;
