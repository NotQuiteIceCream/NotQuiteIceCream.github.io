                        <p class="text-center">Not Quite Ice Cream is a local business based in West Pennant Hills. It
                            was started by Shirley Chan who is a mum of two beautiful girls.&nbsp;
                            <br>
                            <br>Like every mum, Shirley knows children want their party food to be fun
                            and colourful. &nbsp;Shirley made &nbsp;Yumini (short for 'Yummy Minis'
                            ) for her daughter's birthday party to add the 'wow' factor for her and
                            her little friends. &nbsp; Yumini was a huge success.&nbsp;&nbsp;
                            <br>
                            <br>It is the Shirley's hope that Yumini can help raise funds for cancer support
                            and other causes. &nbsp;

                        <p class="text-muted" contenteditable="true">Yumini are mini cone topped with chocolate cluster and finished off with
                            a chocolate dip and sparkles . &nbsp;They are hand- made with all natural
                            quality ingredients, with no artificial flavours and no artifical colours*.
                            &nbsp; Yumini are filled with 100% love and fun ingredients. You can also
                            recreate these Yumini at home using a kit. No special equipment needed.
                            &nbsp;Keep reading for more on Yumini Kit. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
                            <br>
                            <br>Our first Yumini is topped with popcorn Rocky Road and enrobed in dark
                            chocolate. Perfectly balanced with soft chewiness, some crunch and a little
                            sweetness. More flavours are coming.&nbsp;
                            <br>
                            <br>Yuminies can be stored in room temperature. No refrigeration is needed
                            which make them ideal in outdoor parties or functions. As long as they
                            are stored in cool dry places and away from direct sunlight in air tight
                            containers, they will last for at least one month (that is if they are
                            not eaten first!). Refrigeration is not recommended the cool temperature
                            may cause the chocolate to ' bloom' - a white colour layer on top of the
                            chocolate. &nbsp;Blooming does not affect the quality of chocolate, just
                            the appearance.&nbsp;
                            <br>
                            <br>Yuminies are great for birthday parties, weddings, functions, baby showers
                            and&nbsp;girls night-in. &nbsp;&nbsp;

                        <p>Shirley only uses ingredients that she feels comfortable for her own children.
                            All ingredients are carefully selected to include good nutrition without
                            sacrificing the fun factor.&nbsp;

                            <br>There are no artificial flavours or colours in any of the Yuminies*. &nbsp;&nbsp;

                            <br>Gluten free Yuminies are also available - they are equally delicious.
                            Using her knowledge as a qualified dietitian, Shirley checks every single
                            ingredient to ensure they are gluten free. In addition, Shirley also uses
                            separate utensils and equipment to ensure no cross contamination can occur.&nbsp;

                        <p>1. Is Yumini Australian made?
                            <br>Yes. Yumini and the DIY kits are made in the Hills District in Sydney,
                            Australia using local and imported ingredients. Shirley sources Australian
                            ingredients whenever possible.
                            <br>
                            <br>2. Where can I buy Yumini or the DIY kit
                            <br>You can order through ebay at the moment until the Retail function is
                            set up on the website. You can also order through Facebook or email notquiteicecream@gmail.com
                            <br>
                            <br>3. Do you send Australia wide?
                            <br>Yes - the DIY kit can be shipped Australia wide. It is shipped in a tamper
                            proof container that will protect the contents (most importantly the cones).&nbsp;
                            <br>
                            <br>4. Do you have gluten free Yumini?
                            <br>Yes - there are also gluten free Yumini avaialble. The cones are larger
                            than the gluten containing counterpart.&nbsp;
                            <br>
                            <br>5. Does Yumini has any artificial colour, flavours or preservatives?
                            <br>No - Popcorn Rocky Road Yumini does not contain any artificial colour,
                            flavours or preservatives. Organic desscicated coconut, instead of regular
                            desscicated coconut so there is no sulphite.&nbsp;
                            <br>
                            <br>6. What are the charities or causes that you have in mind?
                            <br>Shirley has her local primary school in mind to start. As Yumini gets
                            more traction, Shirley has other organisations including Breast Cancer
                            Network Australia, Save the Children and UNICEF in mind. With your support,
                            these little cones will truly become Cones for Causes. If you have a cause
                            that you are passionate about, please contact us to discuss how Yumini
                            can help your cause.

                            <br>7. Do you have any other topping or flavours?

                            us your idea for new topping and decoration ideas.&nbsp;
