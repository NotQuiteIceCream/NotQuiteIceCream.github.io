                        <p class="text-center">Not Quite Ice Cream is a local business based in West Pennant Hills. It
                            was started by Shirley Chan who is a mum of two beautiful girls.&nbsp;
                            <br>
                            <br>Like every mum, Shirley knows children want their party food to be fun
                            and colourful. &nbsp;Shirley made &nbsp;Yumini (short for 'Yummy Mini'
                            ) for her daughter's birthday party to add the 'wow' factor for her and
                            her little friends. &nbsp; Yumini was a huge success.&nbsp;&nbsp;
                            <br>
                            <br>Shirley created Yumini with hope that it can help to raise funds for cancer support and other for their causes. &nbsp;

                        <p></p>
                        <p class="text-muted">Yumini are mini cones topped with a bliss ball enrobed in chocolate and decorated sparkles . &nbsp;They are hand- made with all natural
                            quality ingredients, with no artificial flavours and no artifical colours*.
                            &nbsp; Yumini are filled with 100% love and fun ingredients. You can also
                            recreate these Yumini at home using a kit. No special equipment needed.
                            &nbsp;Keep reading for more on Yumini Kit. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>The first Yumini was created for Shirley's daughter 7th birthday party. &nbsp;It was topped with Rocky Road and ice cream. After attending a family birthday party, it was obvious Yumini need a topping that can be enjoyed by everyone. So the Cocobliss Yumini was created.<br>
                            <br>Yumini can be stored in room temperature. No refrigeration is needed which
                            make them ideal in outdoor events or functions. As long as they are stored
                            in cool dry places and away from direct sunlight in air tight containers,
                            they will last for at least one month (that is if they are not eaten first!).
                            Refrigeration is not recommended the cool temperature may cause the chocolate
                            to ' bloom' - a white colour layer on top of the chocolate. &nbsp;Blooming
                            does not affect the quality of chocolate, just the appearance.&nbsp;
                            <br>
                            <br>Yumini are great for birthday parties, weddings, functions, baby showers
                            and&nbsp;girls night-in. &nbsp; The colourful 'treasure box' and fun element makes them an attractive item for your organisation's
                            fund raising event. Who can resist Yumini's charm? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

                        <p>1. Is Yumini Australian made?
                            <br>Yes. Yumini and the DIY kits are made in the Hills District in Sydney,
                            Australia using local and imported ingredients. Shirley sources Australian
                            ingredients whenever possible.
                            <br>
                            <br>2. Where can I buy Yumini or the DIY kit
                            <br>You can order through ebay at the moment until the Retail function is
                            set up on the website. You can also order through Facebook or email notquiteicecream@gmail.com
                            <br>
                            <br>3. Do you send Australia wide?
                            <br>Yes - the DIY kit can be shipped Australia wide. It is shipped in a tamper
                            proof container that will protect the contents.<br>
                            <br>4. Do you have gluten free Yumini?
                            <br>Yes - there are also gluten free Yumini avaialble. &nbsp;Please contact Shirley first as the cones are larger than the wheat/gluten containing cones.&nbsp;<br>
                            <br>5. Are Yumini nut free?
                            <br>Nuts are not in cocobliss Yumini as an ingredients. However,
                            as the ingredients that make Yumini may contain traces of nuts or tree
                            nuts, Yumini cannot claim that it is totally nut free.&nbsp;
                            <br>
                            <br>6. Does Yumini has any artificial colour, flavours or preservatives?
                            <br>No -Cocobliis Yumini does not contain any artificial colour,
                            flavours or preservatives. Organic desscicated coconut, instead of regular
                            desscicated coconut, is used so there is no sulphite.&nbsp;
                            <br>
                            <br>7. What are the charities or causes that you have in mind?
                            <br>Shirley has her local primary school in mind to start for their fund raising
                            effort. Other organisations &nbsp;including Breast Cancer
                            Network Australia and Save the Children &nbsp;are other charities Shirley and her support are currently supporting and hope Yumini can be part of it. With your support, these
                            little cones can truly become Cones for Causes. If you have a cause that
                            you are passionate about, please contact us to discuss how Yumini can help
