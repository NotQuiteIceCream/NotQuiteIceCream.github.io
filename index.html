                        <p class="text-center">Not Quite Ice Cream is a local business based in West Pennant Hills, Australia.
                            It was started by Shirley Chan who is a mum of two beautiful girls.&nbsp;
                            <br>
                            <br>Like every mum, Shirley knows children want their party food to be fun
                            and colourful. &nbsp;Shirley made &nbsp;Yumini (short for 'Yummy Mini'
                            ) for one of her daughters' birthday party to add the 'wow' factor for
                            her and her little friends. &nbsp; Yumini was a huge success.&nbsp;&nbsp;
                            <br>
                            <br>Yumini was well received by both adult and children. In additional to
                            adding fun in everyday life, Shirley hopes that Yumini can help to raise
                            funds for cancer support and other causes. &nbsp;

                            <br>The first Yumini was topped with Rocky Road. After attending a family
                            birthday party, it was obvious Yumini needed a topping that can be enjoyed
                            by all generations. So Yumini topped with a 'cocobliss ball' was created.
                            Yumini are great for birthday parties, weddings, functions, baby showers
                            and&nbsp;girls night-in. &nbsp;&nbsp;

                                &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
                                <br>Absolutely! For parties, we found that children can manage two cones on
                                their own. &nbsp; Each kit to contain enough material for 3 children.

                                <br>4. Do you send Australia wide?
                                <br>Yes - the DIY kit can be shipped Australia wide. We use Australia Post.&nbsp;
                                <br>
                                <br>5. Do you have gluten free Yumini?
                                <br>The bliss balls, dipping chocolate and all sprinkles topping are gluten
                                free. The only gluten containing component of Yumin is the mini ice cream
                                cone. The cone can be replaced by a lollypop stick. Just indicate that
                                you need a gluten free Yumini DIY kit when you order.
                                <br>
                                <br>6. What is tempering?
                                <br>Tempering chocolate is an essential step for making smooth, glossy, evenly
                                colored coating for your dipped chocolates. If you plan to make Yumini
                                in advance for your event, we suggest that you temper the dark chocolate
                                for dipping.&nbsp;&nbsp;We can provide you with instruction to how to temper
                                chocolate when you order Yumini.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <br>7. What are the charities or causes that you have in mind?
                                <br>Shirley has her local primary school in mind to start for their fund raising
                                effort. Other organisations &nbsp;including Breast Cancer Network Australia,
                                Canteen and Save the Children are other charities Shirley and her husband
                                are personally supporting. We hope that Yumini can contribute to these
                                charities.&nbsp;
                                <br>
                                <br>With your support, these little cones could truly become Cones for Causes.
                                If you have a cause that you are passionate about, please contact us to
                                discuss how Yumini can help your cause.&nbsp;
                                <br>
                                <br>8. How should I store them?
                                <br>Store Yumini at room temperature in an airtight container in cool dry
                                places and away from direct sunlight once they are made. Refrigeration
                                is not recommended as the cool temperature may cause the chocolate to '
                                bloom' - a white colour layer on top of the chocolate. Blooming does not
                                affect the quality of chocolate, just the appearance. &nbsp;
                                <br>
                                <br>9. How long does it last once I receive them?
                                <br>Yumini is made with all natural ingredients with no preservatives. 'Best
                                By' date is indicated on the label. For Yumini the date is two months from
                                when they are made to ensure they are at the freshest.&nbsp;
                                <br>
                                <br>10. Do you have any other topping or flavours?
                                <br>We are always trying to think of new topping and flavours. Please send
                                us your idea for new topping and decoration ideas.&nbsp;
                                <br>
                                <br>11. What kind of packaging do you use?
                                <br>All the packaging used in Yumini Kit are made from plant, not plastic.
                                The brown paper carton is completely compostable and sustainably-sourced
                                . The clear bags used are cellulose based and can be compostable . Paper

                        <p>Shirley only uses ingredients that she feels comfortable for her own children.
                            All ingredients are carefully selected to include good nutrition without
                            sacrificing the fun factor.&nbsp;
                            <br>
                            <br>There are no artificial flavours or colours in any of the Yumini. &nbsp;
                            They are preservative and sulphite free. &nbsp;Go to FAQ for information

                            <br>Organic tropical coconut perfectly balances the sweetness from Australian
                            dried sultana, currants and organic honey. Australian full cream milk powder
                            give it a creamy mouthfeel and Australian popcorn lends a slight crunch.
                            The cone top is enrobed in a high quality dark chocolate.&nbsp;
