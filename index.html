                        <p class="text-center">Not Quite Ice Cream is a local business based in West Pennant Hills. It
                            was started by Shirley Chan who is a mum of two beautiful girls.&nbsp;
                            <br>
                            <br>Like every mum, Shirley knows children want their party food to be fun
                            and colourful. &nbsp;Shirley made &nbsp;Yumini (short for 'Yummy Mini'
                            ) for her daughter's birthday party to add the 'wow' factor for her and
                            her little friends. &nbsp; Yumini was a huge success.&nbsp;&nbsp;
                            <br>
                            <br>Yumini was well received by both adult and children. Shirley hopes that Yumini can help to raise funds for cancer
                            support and other causes. &nbsp;

                        <p class="text-muted">Yumini are mini cones topped with a bliss ball enrobed in dark chocolate and
                            decorated with sprinkles. &nbsp;They are hand- made with all natural quality
                            ingredients, with no artificial flavours, no artifical colours* and no
                            preservatives. &nbsp; Yumini are filled with 100% love and fun ingredients.
                            You can recreate these Yumini at home using a DIY kit. No special
                            equipments are needed. &nbsp;Keep reading for more on Yumini DIY Kit. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>The first Yumini was created for Shirley's daughter 7th birthday party.
                            &nbsp;It was topped with Rocky Road and ice cream. After attending a family
                            birthday party, it was obvious Yumini need a topping that can be enjoyed
                            by everyone. So Yumini topped with a 'cocobliss ball' was created.
                            <br>
                            <br>Yumini are great for birthday parties, weddings, functions, baby showers
                            and&nbsp;girls night-in. &nbsp; The colourful 'treasure box' and fun element
                            makes them an attractive item for your organisation's fund raising event.
                            Who can resist Yumini's charm? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

                        <p>1. Is Yumini Australian made?
                            <br>Yes. Yumini and the DIY kits are handmade in the Hills District in Sydney,
                            Australia using local and imported ingredients. Shirley sources Australian
                            ingredients whenever possible.
                            <br>
                            <br>2. Where can I buy Yumini or the DIY kit
                            <br>You can order through ebay at the moment until the Retail function is
                            set up on our website. You can also order through Facebook or email notquiteicecream@gmail.com
                            <br>
                            <br>3. Do you send Australia wide?
                            <br>Yes - the DIY kit can be shipped Australia wide. It is shipped in a tamper
                            proof plastic container that will protect the contents. The plastic container is fully recyclable (plastic number 5).<br>
                            <br>4. Do you have gluten free Yumini?
                            <br>Yes - there are also gluten free Yumini avaialble. &nbsp;Please contact
                            Shirley first as the cones are larger than the wheat/gluten containing
                            cones.&nbsp;
                            <br>
                            <br>5. Are Yumini nut free?
                            <br>Nuts are not in cocobliss Yumini as an ingredient. However, as they are home made using ingredients
                            that make Yumini may contain traces of nuts or tree nuts, Yumini is not 100% totally nut free.&nbsp;
                            <br>
                            <br>6. Does Yumini has any artificial colour, flavours or preservatives?
                            <br>No -Cocobliis Yumini does not contain any artificial colour, flavours
                            or preservatives. Organic desscicated coconut, instead of regular desscicated
                            coconut, is used so there is no sulphite.&nbsp;
                            <br>
                            <br>7. What are the charities or causes that you have in mind?
                            <br>Shirley has her local primary school in mind to start for their fund raising
                            effort. Other organisations &nbsp;including Breast Cancer Network Australia,
                            Canteen and Save the Children are other charities Shirley and her husband
                            are personally supporting. We hope that Yumini can contribute to these
                            charities.&nbsp;<br><br>With your support, these little cones could truly become Cones
                            for Causes. If you have a cause that you are passionate about, please contact
                            us to discuss how Yumini can help your cause.&nbsp;
                            <br>
                            <br>8. How should I store them?
                            <br>If the force is with you and your will power can stop yourself from eating
                            them all once you received or made them, we suggest that you store Yumini
                            at room temperature in an airtight container in cool dry places and away from direct sunlight. Refrigeration
                            is not recommended the cool temperature may cause the chocolate to ' bloom'
                            - a white colour layer on top of the chocolate. Blooming does not affect
                            the quality of chocolate, just the appearance. &nbsp;
                            <br>
                            <br>9. How long does it last once I receive them?
                            <br>Yumini is made with all natural ingredients with no preservatives. 'Best
                            By' date is indicated on the label. For Yumini the date is two months from
                            when they are made to ensure they are at the freshest.&nbsp;
                            <br>
                            <br>10. Do you have any other topping or flavours?
                            <br>We are always trying to think of new topping and flavours. Please send
                            us your idea for new topping and decoration ideas.&nbsp;
